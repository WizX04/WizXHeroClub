                <h3>Minoru Mineta (Grape Juice)</h3>
                <p>Hey, everyone! I’m <b>Minoru Mineta</b>, but you can call me Grape Juice! My Quirk, Pop Off, allows me to create sticky balls from my head that can stick to surfaces and trap enemies! I may be a little short, but I’m determined to make a name for myself as a hero!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I may have my quirks (pun intended!), but I’m always here to support my classmates. I’m excited to grow and learn alongside you all, and let’s show the world what Class 1-A is made of!</p>
