            <h2>Do you know the villains that threaten humanity in this world?</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>The Shie Hassaikai is a dangerous yakuza organization that was almost forgotten, but now it’s back—stronger than ever—under the leadership of a villain named Overhaul. He’s using the group to create quirk-erasing bullets, and he’s exploiting a little girl named Eri to do it. It breaks my heart to think about what she’s going through. She’s so young, and her quirk, Rewind, is incredible, but it’s being used for such a terrible purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overhaul is terrifying—his quirk, Overhaul, lets him break apart anything and put it back together however he wants. He’s surrounded by some of the toughest fighters in the group called the Eight Bullets. There’s Rappa, a powerful fighter, and Chronostasis, Overhaul’s right-hand man, who can slow down anyone with his quirk.</p>
            <br>
            <P>But the Shie Hassaikai isn’t the only threat we face. There are other villains lurking in the shadows, each with their own sinister motives, ready to challenge our ideals and disrupt society. They’re aiming to take down hero society and restore the power of the underworld, and I can’t let that happen. We have to stop them and save Eri from this nightmare before it’s too late.</P>

In this world, I see only one path forward: a world free of heroes and filled with my vision of order. I will do whatever it takes to achieve my goals, even if it means using innocent lives as pawns in my game.</p>

I love the thrill of a good fight, and I can’t wait to see how far I can push myself against a real hero. Just remember, once you step into the ring with me, there’s no turning back.</p>

It gives me the advantage to immobilize opponents before they even realize what’s happening. I’m here to ensure that our plans go smoothly, and anyone who gets in our way will regret it.

                <p>Um... I’m Eri. I’m just a girl, but I have a quirk called Rewind. It lets me... um, rewind things to a previous state. Sometimes, I wish I could use it to go back to a time when everything was okay. I don’t really know how to control it, and it’s scary. I’ve been taken away from my home and forced to do things I don’t want to do. It’s hard to explain how lonely it feels.</p>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>It’s also important to know who the League of Villains are. They’re one of the most dangerous organizations we face, united by their desire to dismantle hero society and spread chaos. Their leader is Tomura Shigaraki, and other key members include Kurogiri, Dabi, Toga Himiko, Twice, Mr. Compress, Spinner, and All For One.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The League of Villains operates in secrecy, constantly plotting against heroes and society itself. Each of them has their own motivations, but together they pose a significant threat to peace. Their actions are unpredictable, making them all the more dangerous.</p>
            <br>
            <P>We must be ready to face them at any moment, as they seek to undermine everything we stand for as heroes. Every encounter with them reminds me of the importance of standing strong and never giving up. We will protect our society and fight against the darkness they represent.</P>
