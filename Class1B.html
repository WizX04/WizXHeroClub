                <h3>Juzo Honenuki (Mudman)</h3>
                <p>Hey there! I’m <b>Juzo Honenuki</b>, but you can call me Honenuki. I’m a student in Class 1-B at U.A. High School, training to become a professional hero under the hero name “Mudman.” My quirk, “Softening,” allows me to turn any solid object into a soft, malleable state, which I use strategically in battles to manipulate the environment and my opponents!</p>
                <br>
                <p>What I enjoy most about being in Class 1-B is the strong sense of teamwork and support among my classmates. Everyone has their own unique abilities, and we constantly push each other to improve. I can’t wait to show what Class 1-B can achieve together!</p>

                <p>Hello! I’m <b>Hiryu Rin</b>, but you can just call me Rin. I’m a member of Class 1-B at U.A. High School, training hard to become a professional hero under the hero name “Dragoon.” My quirk, “Scales,” allows me to enhance my physical abilities, giving me the agility and strength reminiscent of a dragon, which I utilize in both combat and rescue situations!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I love being part of Class 1-B because of the incredible diversity of quirks and personalities. We all inspire each other to grow and improve, making our training sessions exciting and productive. I can’t wait to show everyone the potential of Class 1-B and take on any challenges that come our way!</p>
