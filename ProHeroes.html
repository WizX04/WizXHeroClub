            <h2>Toshinori Yagi (All Might)</h2>
            <p>Fear not, for I am here! I am All Might, the Symbol of Peace. With my strength, I protect the weak and inspire hope in all! As the former No. 1 hero, I have dedicated my life to defending justice, but now I have passed the torch, having retired from active duty. Still, my spirit lives on in those who continue the fight. Let's go beyond, PLUS ULTRA!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I never had a formal agency. My mission was always to keep the world at peace by myself. Now, my legacy lies in the hands of young Midoriya, my chosen successor, as I guide him toward becoming the next Symbol of Peace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Without further ado, let's dive into the world of heroes! First up, let's shine a spotlight on our top five pro heroes of this generation.</p>

                <p>Hello, I’m Endeavor, the No. 1 Hero. My quirk is called Hellflame, which allows me to create and control powerful flames at will. My fire is intense, and it can reach extreme temperatures, making me a force to be reckoned with in battle.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I lead the Endeavor Agency, where we prioritize fighting villains and protecting the public with strength and determination. I’ve worked hard to earn my position, and I expect nothing less than excellence from my team. My goal is to surpass All Might and leave a lasting legacy for future heroes. My son, Shoto Todoroki, is my pupil, and I’m determined to help him harness his unique abilities and become a top hero in his own right.

                    <br>
                    <p>I operate out of the Hawks Agency, where we focus on quick response and intelligence gathering to keep the city safe.

                    <p>I lead the Best Jeanist Agency, where we focus on both combatting crime and promoting fashion in the hero community.

               <br>
              <p>I operate out of the Edgeshot Agency, where we specialize in infiltration and intelligence gathering to thwart villainous plans before they unfold.

          <br>
          <p>I operate independently, but I often collaborate with other heroes to take down villains head-on. I’m all about action and getting straight to the point. My motto is to never back down from a fight and to protect those who can’t protect themselves. I believe in putting my all into every battle, and I won’t stop until justice is served! Let’s hop into action and make the world a safer place!</p>

                <p>Yo! I’m Fat Gum, the Pro Hero with a big appetite for justice! My hero name fits perfectly with my quirk, Fat Absorption. I can absorb anything that hits me, storing energy in my body fat and using it to strike back when the time’s right! So, the more hits I take, the harder I hit back!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’m with the Fat Gum Agency over in Osaka, where we specialize in bringing the fight to the bad guys while protecting those in need. But don’t be fooled by my size—underneath all this, I’m as quick as I am strong! My goal is to keep the streets safe and serve up a hearty helping of justice every day. So, if you’re ever in trouble, don’t worry—Fat Gum’s got your back!</p>

My quirk, Orcinus, grants me the abilities of a killer whale on land—superhuman strength, echolocation, and underwater combat expertise. With my quirk, I can incapacitate enemies with powerful sound waves or overpower them with sheer force. Whether on land or sea, no villain can escape my reach.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At my agency, we focus on safeguarding coastal areas, marine life, and the people who live near them. My mission is simple: protect those who cannot protect themselves, and make sure no villain dares threaten the peace of our waters. Remember, if you’re up against the tide of villainy, Gang Orca will be there, ready to strike with the power of the ocean behind me.</p>

With this power, I analyze every detail of a situation, predicting outcomes and making calculated decisions to ensure victory with minimal risk. In the world of heroes, knowledge is power—and I use that knowledge to outthink and outmaneuver my enemies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the Nighteye Agency, we value efficiency, intelligence, and unwavering dedication to justice. My mission is to shape a future where peace prevails and heroism is strategic, not reckless. Rest assured, when I set my sights on the path ahead, there is no room for failure.
